I chose my idea for this project because I was interested in deep work. I find that it is harder to commit to a deep work session if I am not 100% that it is what I should be doing. I figured that a deep work time management application would be a good idea since it could potentially be something that I would use. I did a lot of my project in my head in terms of the planning. The experiment. I honestly waited until about an hour past the last minute to finish up my project. I have not had a good semester at all to be honest and that is 100% reflected in this project. I am most proud of my idea. I am least proud of my prototype. However, this is school so it is not like my prototype would actually be used for anything besides school. My prototype however, did work just well enough to run the experiment. I am so glad that I ran my experiments early and did not wait til the last minute like I did with my paper. The paper took longer than expected so I ran out of time and energy to polish up my prototype. My idea completely changed from what it was in my proposal and that is definitely for the best. I should have had my project proposal revised to reflect this but my name was not good enough to receive credit and I was too embarrassed to have it fixed. I made a lot of mistakes this semester. I let my crumbling personal life impact how I did on this project and I am sorry about that. I make sure I did well on the experiment though as it was said at the start of the semester that the purpose of this class was to teach us how to conduct HCI experiments. In that I think my project was successful. I ran an experiment to not only see what input method would be best for my application, but it also gave me clues what I could do to make my application truly awesome. This project represents this entire class for me and I do think that I have gained a proficient understanding of HCI.
