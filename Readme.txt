I changed my project a lot since the proposal so the new name of it is Inputs Methods and Ideology of Deep Work Time Management Application

My source code is a basic python script that uses tkinter to run. I ran it exclusively on my Mac so hopefully it will work on other machines. I am pretty sure that tkinter is included in most basic python setups. 

The app can be run in anyway that you prefer to run a python script. It hopefully should open up the application in a window.
